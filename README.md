# Labeled-Faces-in-the-Wild
This module provides a basic comparison of some simple machine-learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Network and Convolution Neural Network to compare each of their performance over the famous defacto dataset Labelled Faces in the Wild. Since this is the defacto dataset and is majorly used to test the performance of the algorithms, our approach is not to compete with already implemented results.
